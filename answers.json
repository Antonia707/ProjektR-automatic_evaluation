         "Effectively utilizing a debugger in Visual Studio Code involves a structured process to monitor and analyze program execution. Initiate the debugging journey by strategically placing breakpoints in your source code file, such as program.c, where you want the execution to pause.  Click at the beginning of the line to set a breakpoint at the desired location. Following the  compilation of your program, execute it to observe halts at the breakpoints you've defined. During these pauses, inspect variable values by hovering over their names. It's important to note that uninitialized variables may exhibit unexpected values during this examination. To further navigate trough the program, familiarize yourself with the debugger toolbar icons, including Continue, Step Over, Step Into, Step Out, Restart, and Stop. Each icon corresponds to a fundamental command and is associated with a convenient keyboard shortcut. Gain additional insights into the program's state by checking the Locals window while paused. In larger programs, be aware that some variables may disappear from this window. To address this, you can add variables or expressions to the Watch window for constant monitoring, especially when dealing with variables not in the immediate surrounding of the current statement. Execute specific debugger commands based on your debugging needs: Continue running to the end or the next breakpoint (Continue, F5) Execute the next statement without entering the function code (Step Over, F10) Execute the next statement entering the function code (Step Into, F11) Exit the current function (Step Out, Shift-F11) Restart the program with recompilation (Restart, Ctrl-Shift-F5) Stop the program (Stop, Shift-F5) If the current statement involves a function call, you can use the Step Into action to enter the function code. However, this is typically necessary only in specific scenarios. Conversely, the Step Out action allows you to exit the current function and execute the remaining commands within that function.
